abstract: The recent diffusion of the electronic games has been awakening the interest of researchers which investigate the relationship between the use of games and the increase of human cognitive performance. Starting with that interest, the application of electronic games in the increase of the cognitive performance of the elderly is being explored. In Brazil, access to TV is very common and exists in the homes of every social classes. Thus, electronic games available through the Brazilian Digital TV System have potential to reach great part of the elderly population in the country. The present paper proposes and evaluates the MemoGinga, a short-span memory test program, aimed firstly at the elderly public and implemented in the Ginga middleware for interactive digital TV. MemoGinga was evaluated with elderly users from CRASI - Center of Reference in Assistance to Elderly Health.
