abstract: "In the last decades, the prevalence of the major depressive disorder has risen on a global scale. The debilitating consequences of depression negatively impact multiple areas of a depressed person’s life. A worldwide public health problem, depression, became the focus of many studies to identify possible cases in the general population and to provide them the adequate treatment. On the other hand, in the last years, social networks have become predominant communication tools and inherent to modern life. However, little is known about their impacts on the human mind. Some studies aim to show the connections between excessive use of social networks and the emergence of mental disease symptoms, including depression, while others have shown the social networks’ potential to provide support for users with mental health problems. Given that depression is not restricted by continental or language barriers, studying the disorder in the context of different languages can be a valuable approach for better understanding it. The present study aims at applying natural language processing techniques, particularly, topic modeling in depression-related discussions on Reddit forums. Thus, the aim is to find relevant topics related to depression for users of these communities, in both Portuguese and English languages. With that, we expect to determine: 1) the applicability of natural language processing techniques to find themes associated with depression in Reddit, and 2) the possible similarities and differences between relevant topics for depression for both Portuguese and English-speaking users."
