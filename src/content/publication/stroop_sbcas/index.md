abstract: Recent research has shown that virtual games stimulate the brain in a way that is beneficial to the user’s health, and these are widely used as an aid to the treatment of diseases related to aging.  In addition, studies elucidate the use of sensory effects in the treatment of psychopathologies.  In this way, this paper proposes the Stroop Game,  a cognitive game based on the Stroop test, with a light sensory effect. The game was developed for the Brazilian digital TV, using the Ginga-NCL middleware.  After running Stroop Game tests with elder users, we conclude that the game proposed in this paper was well accepted by the users and that the sensory effect influenced their perception about it, making the game more attractive.
