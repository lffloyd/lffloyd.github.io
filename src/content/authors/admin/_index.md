Hello there! I'm a software developer and computer science graduate at [Universidade Federal Fluminense](http://www.uff.br/), on Brazil. I love building new things, and my main interests are software engineering, algorithms and machine learning. Currently, I'm mostly learning and working with natural language processing and topic models. Also, I have previous works with health-related serious games. Feel free to contact me!
